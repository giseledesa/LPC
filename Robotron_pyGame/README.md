## Enemies

### Grunt

The Force of Ground Roving Unit Network Terminator (GRUNT) Robotrons seek to destroy you. They are the least sophisticated species of Robot. It has no weapon and possesses only minimal intelligence. This does not mean it is to be dealt with lightly. It will single-mindedly pursue you to capture and destroy you.

### Hulk

The Hulk Robotrons seek out and eliminate the last human family. In all attack waves except every 5th, the Hulk will stalk his prey. It alone of the Robot species cannot be killed. Your Laser Gun can only slow it down or divert it from its objective of crushing all life from the humans and from yourself. You must avoid this Robot at all costs or your mission will be lost at the outset.

### Sphereoids & Enforcers

The pulsating sphere may at first look harmless, but it is the mothership which spawns deadly Enforcer Embryos. You must try to explode the Sphereoid before it ejects the Embryos. The Embryos grow into evil Enforcers. Let them live and they will lessen your chance for survival by launching Enforcer Sparks.

### Quarks & Tanks
<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65917017/228015767-875c0498-3627-47b4-a57c-ece47248af05.png">
The Quarks are programmed to manufacture Tank Robotrons. Eliminate the Quarks as quickly as possible before any Tanks can be manufactured. The Tank's goal is to kill you by firing rebounding Shells. Take out the tanks before they have sufficient time to fill the stage with Shells.

### Brains

The Brain is the most clever and dangerous of the Robot species. Its 2-pronged attack will be launched every 5th wave. If it collides with you, it will electrocute you where you stand. It also possesses the devastating power to fire Cruise Missiles which will mercilessly seek you out. Destroy or be destroyed. The victims of the 2nd prong of the Brain's attack are the defenseless humans. If captured, a human will be irreversibly transformed, literally re-programmed by the Brain's incredible mind powers, into a Prog. Into a Robot that will viciously turn against its own protector, against you! Annihilate the Progs or meet a violent death at their hands.

### Electrodes
<img align="left" width="100" height="25" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65917017/228016199-840a0cca-f45c-407a-9290-f91e611f027d.png">
The pulsating, immobile Electrodes will attempt to block your path. Collide with them and meet instant death. Fortunately, the Grunts will also be annihilated by this means. You must avoid the Electrodes or obliterate them with your Laser Gun. In each new attack wave they will assume a different shape, but remain just as deadly if contact is made.


Enjoy.
